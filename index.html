				Hi! Thanks for coming! My nick is grng3r. Iâ€™m just a guy who loves exploring 
                hardware and software, and am cyber security professional, whatever that means.
                This page mostly acts as a personal knowledge base, although my hope is that the page contains as much as 
                original work and random experiences as possible but who knows.
                I will write about security research, cryptography, math, my life abroad and maybe some stuff about the intersection
                of sports and science, etc.
                There is no special content creation goal behind this, apart from satisfying my need to write and testing
                my ability to transfer my knowledge into fun and readable text. That being said, some stuff might be written in
                Croatian, since that is where I come from and haven't written seriously in the language for a long time.
                If you want to contact me for some reason, feel free to either through the email provided or my Twitter
                account, otherwise, enjoy!
