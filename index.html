				Hi! Thanks for coming! My nick is gr@nger (grng3r), yes, it is connectable to a name and a face, but my page, my rules so… All I will give you are the nick and this distorted picture :).
 I’m a computer scientist that loves exploring computers. I code my own projects, work on hardware, do CTF’s and I will use this page to show my work, practice write-ups, hopefully attract some peer-review and learn. I code mostly in Python, C (sometimes C++) and recently Rust, although I have used Java and JavaScript in previous projects. I work on a Debian Linux machine and prefer it over any operating system. I love constructive criticism, so please do, if you want to.

P.S I believe in free software and an open sourced world in general, but that’s just me privately and I appreciate other opinions.
 I do enjoy other activities apart technology, mainly sports, travelling and books, so I spend most of my time, when awk., doing that.
The construction of this page was a long overdue plan for me to practice my project reporting skills and showcase some code. Don’t expect it to be uploaded quite frequently as this page is made mostly with myself in mind.
The only reason I’m bringing it up atm. is to help by hosting an e-zine during COVID. For any of my personal articles you will have to wait a while, as I am currently in the process of finishing a degree.
