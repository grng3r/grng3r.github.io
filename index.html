				Hi! Thanks for coming! My nick is gr@nger [grng3r]. I’m just a guy who loves exploring computers and decided to write about it, first of all for myself, secondly to showcase some of the work I do in my spare time. 
				I code my own projects, work on hardware, do CTF-s, so this is an attempt at practicing write-ups, hopefully attracting some peer-review and learning. I code mostly in Python, Rust and C, on a Debian based Linux system and as you can see I'm not a fan of complicated web-design. 
I believe in free software and an open sourced world in general, but that’s just me privately and I appreciate other opinions.
 I do enjoy other activities apart technology, mainly sports, environmentalism, travelling and books, so there might an odd article here and there about some of those topics.
The construction of this page was a long overdue plan, but don’t expect it to be uploaded quite frequently as this page is made mostly with myself in mind.

If you decide to have a look around, hope you enjoy and find some of the stuff I do is cool. Feel free to reach out.

During the first COVID pandemic the page was used to host a publication[zine] about architecture, this is what the Beta Vulgaris subpage is about.
